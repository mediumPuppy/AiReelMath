Below is a concise, bullet-point summary of ReelMath’s features, along with best practices and resources:

- **Interactive Math Learning Platform**
  - A TikTok-style Flutter app to engage math learners with short videos and quizzes.

- **File Structure**
  - lib/
    - screens/: Contains distinct screens for each feature (upload answer, filtering topics, quizzes, comments).
    - widgets/: Houses reusable UI components (progress bars, video players, rating widgets, etc.) to ensure UI consistency and separation of concerns.
    - services/: Includes shared helper classes and functions (for Firebase services) to minimize duplication.
    - models/: Optional folder to keep data model classes that help in structuring and validating data from Firestore.

- **Core Features**
  - **Handwritten Answer Evaluation**  
    - Capture photos of handwritten answers using the device camera via the `image_picker` package.  
    - Evaluate answers using the Mathpix API integrated through Firebase Cloud Functions.
  - **Learning Topics & Filters**  
    - Access math topics with structured learning paths (e.g., from basic arithmetic to multiplication).  
    - Filter content by difficulty using dropdowns and Firestore queries.
  - **Periodic Quizzes**  
    - Provide quizzes along the learning path, starting with hard-coded questions then moving to dynamic question retrieval via Firestore.
  - **Progress Tracking**  
    - Visual progress indicators (simple progress bars or circular indicators) that track completed videos and quizzes.
  - **Video Playback Control**  
    - Custom video player widget with pause/unpause functionality using the `video_player` package.
  - **Concept Understanding Rating**  
    - Allow learners to rate videos (like/dislike) to determine if they understand the concept—potentially triggering additional foundational content if a video is disliked.
  - **Prerequisite Topic Indicator**  
    - Visual bubbles (red for missing, green for completed) to show whether the user has covered all prerequisite topics before tackling advanced concepts.
  - **Creator Feedback**  
    - Enable liking/disliking creators so recommendations can be adjusted accordingly.
  - **Commenting System**
    - Real-time comments on videos powered by Firestore and Cloud Messaging, supporting in-app discussion.

- **Backend & Stack Considerations**
  - **Firebase Services:**  
    - Firebase Auth for secure authentication and social logins.  
    - Firebase Cloud Storage to manage video assets and images.  
    - Firestore as the primary real-time NoSQL database.  
    - Cloud Functions to safely integrate external services and offload compute-intensive tasks.  
    - Cloud Messaging for real-time updates.
  - **Future AI Integration:**  
    - Architecture designed to easily incorporate generative AI features via Firebase Cloud Functions and external APIs.

- **Best Practices**
  - **Modularization & Separation of Concerns:**  
    - Keep Flutter widgets and screens decoupled for easier maintenance and future scalability.
  - **Secure API Key Management:**  
    - Store sensitive API keys (e.g., Mathpix credentials) in Firebase Cloud Functions environment configurations.
  - **Real-time Data Handling:**  
    - Utilize `StreamBuilder` for Firestore data to ensure a smooth, real-time user experience.
  - **Dependency Management:**  
    - Define and manage dependencies in `pubspec.yaml` (e.g., `firebase_core`, `image_picker`, `video_player`, `http`).
  - **Clean UI and Navigation:**  
    - Use Flutter Material design principles and clean navigation architecture (consider named routes or packages like `go_router`).
