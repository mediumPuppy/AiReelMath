# Combined Instructions for a Whiteboard Drawing and Speech System

This document outlines a comprehensive approach to create a **Khan Academy–style “whiteboard”** drawing system that progressively renders math visuals in sync with speech. It covers a detailed JSON structure for describing the drawing, an implementation guide in Flutter (including data models, parsing, animation, custom painting, and speech synchronization), and revised step-by-step instructions for a pre-existing `WhiteboardScreen` approach.

---

## Part 1: JSON Structure and Implementation Approach

### 1. Updated JSON Structure (Example)

Below is an **example** of a refined JSON structure tailored to the “whiteboard” style drawing (Khan Academy–style) for a math lesson. This structure includes metadata, drawing instructions with timing details, drawing element specifications, and speech script information.

```jsonc
{
  "metadata": {
    "topicTitle": "Right Triangles",
    "topicSubtitle": "Basic Properties",
    "author": "Math Instructor AI",
    "estimatedDurationSeconds": 120
  },
  "instructions": {
    "timing": [
      {
        "stage": "triangle_outline",
        "startTime": 0,
        "endTime": 2,
        "description": "Progressively draw the triangle outline by connecting vertices A, B, and C.",
        "easing": "easeInOut" // Optional
      },
      {
        "stage": "right_angle_marker",
        "startTime": 2,
        "endTime": 4,
        "description": "Draw the right angle marker at vertex A and gradually fade in the '90°' annotation.",
        "easing": "linear" // Optional
      },
      {
        "stage": "angle_arcs",
        "startTime": 4,
        "endTime": 6,
        "description": "Animate the drawing of the internal angle arcs for vertices B and C.",
        "easing": "easeIn"
      },
      {
        "stage": "labels_and_details",
        "startTime": 6,
        "endTime": 8,
        "description": "Progressively place and fade in the labels A, B, and C near their respective vertices.",
        "easing": "easeOut"
      }
    ],
    "drawing": {
      // Could be multiple grouped drawing instructions:
      "triangle": {
        "vertices": [
          { "x": 0, "y": 0 },
          { "x": 60, "y": 0 },
          { "x": 30, "y": 40 }
        ],
        "style": "stroke",
        "strokeWidth": 2,
        "color": "#444444"
      },
      "rightAngle": {
        "vertex": { "x": 0, "y": 0 },
        "markerLength": 15,
        "fadeInRange": { "start": 0.8, "end": 1.0 },
        "color": "#FF0000"
      },
      "angleArcs": [
        {
          "vertex": { "x": 60, "y": 0 },
          "referencePoint": { "x": 0, "y": 0 },
          "radius": 20,
          "progressMapping": "stageProgress",
          "color": "#00AAFF"
        },
        {
          "vertex": { "x": 30, "y": 40 },
          "referencePoint": { "x": 60, "y": 0 },
          "radius": 20,
          "progressMapping": "stageProgress",
          "color": "#00AAFF"
        }
      ],
      "labels": [
        {
          "text": "A",
          "position": { "x": -15, "y": -15 },
          "color": "#000000",
          "fadeInRange": { "start": 0.0, "end": 1.0 }
        },
        {
          "text": "B",
          "position": { "x": 10, "y": -15 },
          "color": "#000000"
        },
        {
          "text": "C",
          "position": { "x": 10, "y": 10 },
          "color": "#000000"
        }
      ]
    },
    "speech": {
      "script": "We begin by drawing the triangle’s outline as a smooth and continuous line connecting the vertices. Next, a right angle marker is drawn at vertex A, with the '90°' label gradually appearing. After that, soft arcs are animated to represent the angles at vertices B and C. Finally, labels A, B, and C are added with a gentle fade, clarifying each vertex in this step-by-step construction.",
      "pacing": {
        "initialDelay": 0.5,
        "betweenStages": 1.0,
        "finalDelay": 1.0
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Notable Improvements

1. **Added `metadata`**: A new top-level object for lesson-wide info (like topic title, subtitle, author, and total duration estimate).
2. **Optional `easing`**: Each stage has an optional `easing` property to allow for more fine-grained or advanced animations if desired.
3. **Expanded Drawing Properties**: 
   - `color` is added for each element for more direct styling.
   - `fadeInRange` for controlling alpha transitions on certain elements.
4. **Modularity**: The structure remains modular enough that you can easily add new stages, new shapes, or new annotation elements.

### 2. Suggested Implementation Approach in Flutter

Below is a detailed approach with code snippets, checklists, and step-by-step tasks to guide your developer in creating a **Khan Academy–style “whiteboard”** screen with synchronized speech.

#### 2.1 High-Level Objectives

- **Parse the JSON** into strongly typed Dart models.  
- **Build a timeline** (using `TickerProvider` or `AnimationController`) that drives each stage’s progress from `0.0` to `1.0`.  
- **Use a `CustomPainter`** to progressively draw lines, arcs, and text based on the current stage’s animation value.  
- **Synchronize** the drawing timeline with any voiceover or text-to-speech.  
- **Provide user controls** for playback (pause, play, scrub).

---

#### 2.2 Data Models & Parsing

##### Create Model Classes

Create a file (e.g., `drawing_spec_models.dart`):

```dart
// drawing_spec_models.dart

import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class DrawingStage {
  final String stage;
  final double startTime;
  final double endTime;
  final String description;
  final String? easing;

  DrawingStage({
    required this.stage,
    required this.startTime,
    required this.endTime,
    required this.description,
    this.easing,
  });
}

class DrawingSpec {
  // Keep references to the shapes, arcs, labels, etc.
  // For simplicity, let's define a quick shape structure:
  final List<Offset> vertices;
  final double strokeWidth;
  final Color color;
  final String style; // "stroke" or "fill"

  DrawingSpec({
    required this.vertices,
    required this.strokeWidth,
    required this.color,
    required this.style,
  });
}

// More classes for RightAngleMarker, AngleArc, Label, etc.
// ...
```

##### JSON Parsing

Create a parser file (e.g., `drawing_spec_parser.dart`):

```dart
// drawing_spec_parser.dart

import 'dart:convert';
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'drawing_spec_models.dart';

class DrawingSpecParser {
  static Future<List<DrawingStage>> parseStages(dynamic jsonMap) async {
    List stagesJson = jsonMap['instructions']['timing'];
    return stagesJson.map((item) {
      return DrawingStage(
        stage: item['stage'],
        startTime: (item['startTime'] as num).toDouble(),
        endTime: (item['endTime'] as num).toDouble(),
        description: item['description'],
        easing: item['easing'],
      );
    }).toList();
  }

  static Future<DrawingSpec> parseTriangleSpec(dynamic jsonMap) async {
    final triangleJson = jsonMap['instructions']['drawing']['triangle'];
    List verticesJson = triangleJson['vertices'];
    return DrawingSpec(
      vertices: verticesJson
          .map((v) => Offset((v['x'] as num).toDouble(), (v['y'] as num).toDouble()))
          .toList(),
      strokeWidth: (triangleJson['strokeWidth'] as num).toDouble(),
      color: _hexToColor(triangleJson['color'] ?? "#000000"),
      style: triangleJson['style'],
    );
  }

  // ... similarly parse rightAngle, angleArcs, labels, etc.

  static Color _hexToColor(String hexCode) {
    // Remove any leading # if present
    final buffer = StringBuffer();
    if (hexCode.length == 7) {
      buffer.write('ff');
    }
    buffer.write(hexCode.replaceFirst('#', ''));
    return Color(int.parse(buffer.toString(), radix: 16));
  }
}
```

---

#### 2.3 Animation & Timeline Control

You will likely need:

1. A master `AnimationController` that runs from `0.0` to the total lesson duration (e.g., 0 to 8 seconds if your last stage ends at 8).
2. **Alternatively**, separate controllers for each stage. You can chain them in a sequence or orchestrate them with a single timeline.

##### Single Timeline Example

```dart
// In your screen widget, e.g. drawing_and_speech_screen.dart

class DrawingAndSpeechScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _DrawingAndSpeechScreenState createState() => _DrawingAndSpeechScreenState();
}

class _DrawingAndSpeechScreenState extends State<DrawingAndSpeechScreen>
    with SingleTickerProviderStateMixin {
  late AnimationController _controller;
  final double _totalDuration = 8.0; // from your JSON's last endTime

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _controller = AnimationController(
      vsync: this,
      duration: Duration(seconds: _totalDuration.toInt()),
    );

    // Optionally start the animation
    _controller.forward();
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    _controller.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text("Drawing and Speech Demo"),
      ),
      body: AnimatedBuilder(
        animation: _controller,
        builder: (context, child) {
          double currentTime = _controller.value * _totalDuration;
          return CustomPaint(
            size: Size.infinite,
            painter: HumanLikeDrawingPainter(
              currentTime: currentTime,
              // pass in your parsed specs, stages, etc.
            ),
          );
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

---

#### 2.4 Custom Painting for Human-Like Drawing

To draw lines progressively like a human, you can:

- Compute a `Path` for the shape (e.g., the triangle).
- Use **`PathMetrics`** and **`extractPath`** to reveal only a portion of the path (from `0.0` to some fraction).
- Increase that fraction over time based on the stage’s `startTime` → `endTime` range.

##### Example Painter

```dart
// human_like_drawing_painter.dart

import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class HumanLikeDrawingPainter extends CustomPainter {
  final double currentTime;
  // You'd also store references to your list of stages,
  // and drawing specs for triangle, angle arcs, labels, etc.
  
  HumanLikeDrawingPainter({
    required this.currentTime,
  });

  @override
  void paint(Canvas canvas, Size size) {
    _drawTriangle(canvas, size);
    // other calls like _drawRightAngleMarker, _drawAngleArcs, _drawLabels, etc.
  }

  void _drawTriangle(Canvas canvas, Size size) {
    // Example: if the stage is from 0 to 2 sec, we find what fraction
    // of 0→2 we are currently at:
    double start = 0.0;
    double end = 2.0;
    double fraction = 0.0;

    if (currentTime <= start) {
      fraction = 0.0;
    } else if (currentTime >= end) {
      fraction = 1.0;
    } else {
      fraction = (currentTime - start) / (end - start);
    }

    // Build a path for the triangle
    Path trianglePath = Path();
    // Example coords:
    trianglePath.moveTo(0, 0);
    trianglePath.lineTo(60, 0);
    trianglePath.lineTo(30, 40);
    trianglePath.close();

    // Get partial path:
    PathMetrics metrics = trianglePath.computeMetrics();
    Path partialPath = Path();
    for (PathMetric metric in metrics) {
      // 0.0 to fraction * metric.length
      double lengthToReveal = metric.length * fraction;
      partialPath.addPath(metric.extractPath(0, lengthToReveal), Offset.zero);
    }

    // Draw the partial path
    Paint paint = Paint()
      ..color = Colors.black
      ..strokeWidth = 2
      ..style = PaintingStyle.stroke;

    canvas.drawPath(partialPath, paint);
  }

  @override
  bool shouldRepaint(covariant HumanLikeDrawingPainter oldDelegate) {
    return oldDelegate.currentTime != currentTime;
  }
}
```

**Key Idea:**  
Each shape (triangle outline, angle arcs, etc.) is drawn based on a fraction derived from  
`(currentTime - stage.startTime) / (stage.endTime - stage.startTime)`. The same principle applies for text fade-in by controlling `Paint` alpha or by conditionally drawing elements.

---

#### 2.5 Speech Integration

1. **Text-to-Speech**: Use a package like [`flutter_tts`](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_tts) to orchestrate the narration.  
2. **Sync with Animation**: Start your TTS playback after an optional `initialDelay`, then break your script up for stage-by-stage narration, or read the entire script in one shot while your animation runs on a timeline.

Example service:

```dart
// speech_service.dart (optional)

import 'package:flutter_tts/flutter_tts.dart';

class SpeechService {
  final FlutterTts _tts = FlutterTts();

  Future<void> speak(String text) async {
    await _tts.speak(text);
  }

  Future<void> stop() async {
    await _tts.stop();
  }
}
```

And in your screen:

```dart
// ...
@override
void initState() {
  super.initState();
  // parse JSON, build your data structure
  // ...
  // Use a delay to start TTS slightly after animation if needed
  Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 1), () {
    // speechService.speak(parsedSpeechScript);
  });
}
// ...
```

---

#### 2.6 Implementation Instructions (Checklist)

Below is a refined checklist for your developer to follow:

1. **Initial Project Setup**  
   - [ ] Add a new screen in the app’s drawer/menu called “Drawing & Speech Demo.”  
   - [ ] Create `drawing_and_speech_screen.dart` with a scaffold.  

2. **JSON & Models**  
   - [ ] Define data model classes in `drawing_spec_models.dart` (e.g., `DrawingStage`, `DrawingSpec`, etc.).  
   - [ ] Create a parser in `drawing_spec_parser.dart` that:  
     - [ ] Reads the top-level `metadata`.  
     - [ ] Parses each stage in `timing`.  
     - [ ] Parses each drawing element (triangle, arcs, labels, etc.).  
     - [ ] Converts `color` hex strings to Flutter `Color`.  

3. **Main Timeline & Animation**  
   - [ ] Implement a single `AnimationController` in your screen.  
   - [ ] Determine total lesson duration from the final stage’s `endTime`.  
   - [ ] Use an `AnimatedBuilder` or `addListener()` to trigger UI rebuilds as the controller ticks.  

4. **Custom Painter**  
   - [ ] Create `human_like_drawing_painter.dart` (extends `CustomPainter`).  
   - [ ] For each stage, calculate the `fraction` of completion from `(currentTime - startTime) / (endTime - startTime)`.  
   - [ ] Build the shape `Path` and extract partial paths with `PathMetric` for progressive drawing.  
   - [ ] Fade in labels by controlling alpha or skipping drawing until a given `fraction` is reached.  

5. **Speech Synchronization**  
   - [ ] Implement a `SpeechService` with `flutter_tts`.  
   - [ ] Decide if you want a single script read at once or stage-by-stage narration.  
   - [ ] Start TTS playback in `initState()` with an optional initial delay.  

6. **User Controls & Testing**  
   - [ ] Provide **Play** and **Pause** buttons to control the `AnimationController`.  
   - [ ] Optionally add a slider to let the user scrub the timeline from 0% to 100%.  
   - [ ] Verify that the drawing elements appear in the correct order and timing.  
   - [ ] Listen carefully to the TTS narration to confirm it lines up with the visuals.  

7. **Refinements & Polishes**  
   - [ ] Integrate more “human-like” randomness if desired (vary stroke speed slightly).  
   - [ ] Add more shapes or dynamic labeling from the JSON.  
   - [ ] Use advanced easing curves or custom curves for more natural transitions.  
   - [ ] Make the canvas scrollable if the content grows vertically.

## Part 2: Revised Step-by-Step Implementation Instructions

This section provides a **concise yet comprehensive** guide that explains how to set up a drawing and speech system similar to Khan Academy’s style. These instructions specifically reference the existing `WhiteboardScreen` approach in your codebase (which draws letters, numbers, math symbols, etc.) and **omit** any advanced easing in favor of a simple linear animation.

### 1. Goal Overview

- **Animate** the drawing of math expressions or general whiteboard sketches **in sequence**.  
- **Keep timing** accurate so each stroke appears gradually from **0% to 100%** over a fixed duration (or based on the total path length).  
- **Optionally** sync to speech or voiceover if needed (not shown here but easy to add).

---

### 2. Data Flow & Where It Lives

1. **`WhiteboardScreen`**  
   - Accepts optional `drawingCommands` (a list of instructions like `moveTo`, `lineTo`, `quadraticBezierTo`) **or** a raw `String` text.  
   - If `drawingCommands` **are provided**, it interprets them to build the paths.  
   - If `drawingCommands` **are absent**, it uses a built-in method (`_initializePaths()`) to generate strokes for each character in the `text`.

2. **`EquationPainter`**  
   - Uses an `AnimatedBuilder` or `CustomPainter` lifecycle to incrementally render partial paths based on animation progress (`_controller.value`).  
   - The stroke drawing is cumulative: as progress increases, more of each path is shown.

3. **Animation Logic**  
   - A single `AnimationController` runs from `0` to `1` over a specified `duration` (default 10 seconds).  
   - The total length of all paths is computed at initialization.  
   - At each frame, multiply the current `progress` by the `totalLength` to determine how many units of line to draw.  
   - Then iterate over each path in order, subtracting each path’s length from that “available line length” until finished.

---

### 3. Implementing or Modifying the JSON Approach (Optional)

If you have a **JSON** describing shapes or strokes (like `drawingCommands`), **parse** it into a list of commands (`moveTo`, `lineTo`, etc.). For example:

```jsonc
{
  "drawingCommands": [
    { "type": "moveTo", "params": {"x": 50, "y": 200} },
    { "type": "lineTo", "params": {"x": 100, "y": 200} },
    ...
  ]
}
```

Then pass that list to your `WhiteboardScreen(drawingCommands: parsedCommands)` constructor. This replaces or supplements the built-in `_initializePaths()` logic that draws numbers and symbols from a text string.

---

### 4. WhiteboardScreen Explanation

Below is the main flow in `WhiteboardScreen`:

1. **Initialization**  
   ```dart
   _controller = AnimationController(
     vsync: this,
     duration: widget.duration,  // e.g., 10 seconds
   );
   ```

2. **Building Paths**  
   - If you **have** `drawingCommands`, call `_initializeFromCommands()` to build `Path` objects.  
   - If you **only have** a `text`, call `_initializePaths()` to parse each character into a hand-crafted `Path`.  

3. **Calculating Path Lengths**  
   - For each `Path`, compute the total length by iterating through `PathMetrics`.  
   - Sum these lengths to get `_totalLength`.  

4. **Forward the Animation**  
   ```dart
   _controller.forward();
   _controller.addStatusListener((status) {
     if (status == AnimationStatus.completed && widget.onAnimationComplete != null) {
       widget.onAnimationComplete!();
     }
   });
   ```

5. **`AnimatedBuilder`**  
   - Rebuilds the `CustomPaint` each frame.  
   - Passes `progress = _controller.value` into the `EquationPainter`.

---

### 5. EquationPainter Explanation

1. **Receiving State**  
   The painter gets:
   ```dart
   final List<Path> paths;
   final List<double> pathLengths; 
   final double totalLength; 
   final double progress; // 0.0 to 1.0
   ```

2. **Drawing Incrementally**  
   ```dart
   double currentProgress = progress * totalLength;

   for (int i = 0; i < paths.length; i++) {
     if (currentProgress <= 0) break;

     final path = paths[i];
     final pLength = pathLengths[i];
     final pathProgress = (currentProgress / pLength).clamp(0.0, 1.0);

     if (pathProgress > 0) {
       // Use PathMetric to extract partial path
       for (final metric in path.computeMetrics()) {
         final extractPath = metric.extractPath(0, metric.length * pathProgress);
         canvas.drawPath(extractPath, paint);
       }
     }
     currentProgress -= pLength;
   }
   ```
   - For the current frame, the code calculates how many “units of line” can be drawn (`currentProgress`).  
   - It then iterates over each path, drawing the entire path if possible, or a partial path if only a portion fits.  
   - The drawing order is the exact order in which the paths appear in the list.

3. **Result**  
   - The shape is drawn **in the exact order** the paths appear.  
   - All shapes appear linearly over the total animation duration.  
   - For different timing per shape (e.g., a shape starting at second 2 and ending at second 4), add logic to segment the overall animation into intervals or compute partial progress based on time offsets.

---

### 6. Timing Considerations

- **Linear Speed**: Multiplying `progress * totalLength` draws the lines at a **constant** speed from start to finish.  
- **Segmented Durations**: For a shape to start at a specific second (e.g., second 2) and end at another (e.g., second 4), add logic to check if `(currentTime >= 2)` and `(currentTime <= 4)`, or break your total path length into segments mapped to different times.  
- **No Easing**: The provided code uses a simple linear approach. If easing is desired (e.g., `Curves.easeIn` or `Curves.easeOut`), wrap your progress in a `CurvedAnimation`.

---

### 7. Speech Integration (Optional)

- To **sync** narration, use a TTS package (like [flutter_tts](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_tts)) and start speaking when `_controller.forward()` is called.  
- For advanced sync (e.g., speaking a phrase exactly when a shape is fully drawn), add an `AnimationStatusListener` or a periodic timer to check elapsed time.

---

### 8. Checklist for the Developer

1. **Use the Provided `WhiteboardScreen`**  
   - [ ] Confirm that you pass either `drawingCommands` or a `text`.  
   - [ ] Decide on `duration` (default 10 seconds or longer if the expression is complex).

2. **Add or Modify Paths**  
   - [ ] If you have special shapes or want to animate new glyphs, edit `_initializePaths()` or `_initializeFromCommands()` with the new drawing logic.

3. **Check Total Path Length**  
   - [ ] Debug `_totalLength` to ensure it matches expectations (some shapes might be very short or long).

4. **Test the Animation**  
   - [ ] Run the screen.  
   - [ ] Verify that each stroke is drawn in sequence.  
   - [ ] Click the replay button (e.g., an `IconButton` in the AppBar) to reset.

5. **(Optional) Fine-Tune Speed**  
   - [ ] Adjust `duration` in the constructor.  
   - [ ] Modify the code to segment the total path into parts if stage-by-stage timings are required.

6. **(Optional) Integrate Audio**  
   - [ ] Use TTS or custom audio clips for narration.  
   - [ ] Start or coordinate audio playback with `_controller.forward()`.

---

## Final Thoughts

By **parsing a well-structured JSON** and **using Flutter’s CustomPainter** with an **AnimationController**, you can **progressively “hand-draw”** math visuals in sync with a **voice narration**. This architecture makes it straightforward to **extend the lesson** with new shapes, new annotation elements, or different timing curves without rewriting core drawing logic.

Key tasks include:

- Building robust data models to parse the JSON.
- Implementing partial path drawing with `PathMetrics`.
- Managing a timeline that respects each stage’s start and end times.
- Integrating TTS to narrate the drawing as it appears.

Once this foundation is in place, you’ll have a **Khan Academy–style** drawing system ready to **engage learners with real-time illustrated math explanations**.

Good luck, and enjoy building it!
