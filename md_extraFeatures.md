### Dynamic Skill Tree

- **Data Modeling**
  - **Structure Definition**
    - Define a "node" (representing a topic or mini-boss challenge) with:
      - Unique identifier (ID)
      - Title (e.g., “Fractions: Basics” or “Algebra Mini-Boss”)
      - Unlocked status (boolean to track if the node is available)
      - List of child nodes (to represent progression branches)
      - Flag for mini-boss challenges (to distinguish tougher quizzes)
  - **Firestore Integration**
    - Store each user’s skill tree progress in Firestore
      - E.g., use a document structure where each node’s status is recorded via a key-value pair (node ID: true/false)
    - Data model can evolve to include additional metadata such as completion time or score
  
- **Interactive UI**
  - **Visualization**
    - Design a graph-like view rather than a static list
      - Use Flutter’s `CustomPaint` or a third-party graph library to draw nodes and connecting branches
    - Display nodes as interactive icons or cards
      - Animated effects (e.g., glowing borders or hover effects) for unlocked nodes
  - **User Interaction**
    - On tapping a node:
      - If the node is unlocked, navigate to a detailed topic view or a mini-boss challenge screen
      - Present clear visual cues (e.g., animation transitions) to indicate progression or available challenges
    - Incorporate mini-boss screens:
      - Highlight these with distinct visuals and animations to signal increased difficulty
      - After passing the mini-boss, reveal secret tips or bonus content

- **Progression Logic**
  - **Data Update**
    - On successful completion of any node or mini-boss challenge:
      - Update the corresponding status in Firestore immediately
      - Trigger UI refresh to unlock and reveal new branches
  - **Feedback and Reward Animation**
    - Deploy animations when new nodes are unlocked:
      - A “pop” animation or celebratory transition upon completion of challenges
    - Consider bonus rewards:
      - Bonus points or unlocked secret tips that become visually accessible
