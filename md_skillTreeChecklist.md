# Skill Tree Implementation Checklist

## 1. Data Model Setup
- [x] Create `skill.dart` model based on existing `topic.dart`
  - [x] Add additional fields:
    - [x] `List<String> childSkillIds` (for progression branches)
    - [x] `bool isUnlocked` (track availability)
    - [x] `bool isMiniChallenge` (for mini-boss nodes)
    - [x] `String? prerequisiteSkillId` (optional parent skill)
    - [x] `int difficultyLevel` (1-5 scale)
    - [x] `Map<String, dynamic> rewards` (for completion rewards)
  - [x] Migrate relevant fields from Topic:
    - [x] title
    - [x] description
    - [x] videoUrl
    - [x] thumbnailUrl
    - [x] etc.

## 2. Firebase/Firestore Integration
- [x] Create skills collection in Firestore
- [x] Create user_progress collection to track:
  - [x] Completed skills
  - [x] Unlocked skills
  - [x] Performance metrics
- [x] Set up Firestore service methods:
  - [x] `getSkills()`
  - [x] `updateSkillProgress()`
  - [x] `unlockSkill()`
  - [x] `getSkillProgress()`

## 3. UI Implementation
- [ ] Create `skill_tree_screen.dart`
  - [ ] Implement basic layout structure
  - [ ] Add AppBar with appropriate navigation
  - [ ] Create skill node widget
  - [ ] Implement node connections visualization
- [ ] Create supporting widgets:
  - [ ] `skill_node_widget.dart` (for individual nodes)
  - [ ] `skill_connection_painter.dart` (for drawing connections)
  - [ ] `skill_details_modal.dart` (for node details)
  - [ ] `mini_boss_badge.dart` (for challenge nodes)

## 4. Navigation & Routing
- [ ] Add skill tree route to main navigation
- [ ] Implement navigation logic between:
  - [ ] Skill tree → Skill details
  - [ ] Skill details → Video player
  - [ ] Skill details → Quiz/Challenge

## 5. State Management
- [ ] Create skill tree provider/controller
  - [ ] Track current user progress
  - [ ] Handle skill unlocking logic
  - [ ] Manage skill tree layout calculations
  - [ ] Handle user interactions

## 6. Animations & Visual Effects
- [ ] Implement node state animations:
  - [ ] Locked state
  - [ ] Unlocked state
  - [ ] Completion animation
  - [ ] Mini-boss challenge effects
- [ ] Add connection line animations
- [ ] Create celebration effects for completion

## 7. Data Migration
- [ ] Create initial skill tree data structure
- [ ] Convert existing topics to skills
- [ ] Set up proper skill relationships
- [ ] Define progression paths

## 8. Testing & Validation
- [ ] Unit tests for Skill model
- [ ] Integration tests for Firestore service
- [ ] Widget tests for skill tree screen
- [ ] User flow testing
- [ ] Performance testing with large skill sets

## 9. Polish & Optimization
- [ ] Implement lazy loading for large skill trees
- [ ] Add progress caching
- [ ] Optimize animations for performance
- [ ] Add error handling and loading states

## 10. Documentation
- [ ] Document skill tree architecture
- [ ] Create usage guidelines
- [ ] Add code documentation
- [ ] Update project README

## Implementation Order
1. Start with data model and Firestore integration ✓
2. Create basic UI structure
3. Implement core navigation
4. Add state management
5. Integrate animations
6. Polish and optimize
7. Add tests and documentation

## Notes
- Maintain compatibility with existing video feed feature
- Ensure smooth integration with current navigation flow
- Focus on performance with larger skill sets
- Keep UI consistent with existing app design
